The first model with GridCV is more accurate. When initially getting the X score it was 0.856. And, after doing the grid search the 
best value was 0.866. This means we can predict exoplanets with this data with a fairly high degree of accuracy.


The logistical regression model was not as accurate yeilding a testing score of only 0.629. This means we would not be able to predict exoplanets
with a very high degree of accuracy with this model.


To make this more accurate, we could get more data, or fine tune the parameters to only be showing the most relevent columns. 
Without knowing much about this subject and its abbreviations, it's hard to know exactly how to do this myself.
